## Welcome to The RADIANT Systems Lab!



The Radiant Systems Lab directed by <a href="https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/tanu-malik/">Dr. Tanu Malik</a> is located in the <a href="https://engineering.missouri.edu/departments/eecs/">Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.missouri.edu">University of Missouri-Columbia (Mizzou)</a>. This lab is a front runner in the design of reproducible, accountable, and trustworthy data-driven systems and infrastructure. This lab aims to advance reproducible, accountable, explainable, and policy-aware data science by developing systems that enhance the reliability of data-intensive, distributed, and parallel scientific workflows through accountable and reproducible containerization. It also focuses on improving transparency in artificial intelligence by making data, algorithms, and decision-making processes within scientific workflows more interpretable and understandable.

The focus of the research performed in this lab includes but is not limited to:

- **Reproducible and Accountable Systems (RAS):**  
  Improving data-intensive, distributed, and parallel science workflows with reproducible and accountable containers.

- **Transparent and Explainable AI (XAI):**  
  Make data, algorithms, and decision-making processes in science workflows explainable and understandable.

- **Infrastructure and Policy (INP):**  
  Engage in resource and systems optimization of infrastructure, guided by policy frameworks.
