## Sciunit
----------

**Sciunit** is a suite of tools that create light-weight containers from reference executions of an application. The suite consists of tools for command-line applications, notebook applications, and data-intensive applications. In each tool, multiple executions of an application can be efficiently containerized using content-based deduplication. Resulting containers can be repeated in compatible x86-based Linux kernel environments. Users can also reproduce executions by changing input parameters or datasets. Sciunit facilitates sharing of self-contained applications between collaborators. Audited provenance in Sciunit can also be used to provide repeatability and reproducibility gurantees. Please refer to Sciunit's `documentation
<https://github.com/depaul-dice/sciunit/wiki>`_ to learn how to install and use it.

## Floability
-----------

**Floability** is a system that will enable the rapid and portable deployment of notebooks expressing complex scientific workflows across a wide range of cyberinfrastructure. The key technical challenge is that workflows are incomplete: the code by itself cannot be moved between facilities without accurately capturing the software dependencies, required datasets, and capabilities of the underlying cluster hardware. In addition it aims to solve the problem of translating notebooks to workflows and vice versa. Floability is collaboratively developed by the University of Notre Dame, the University of Missouri-Columbia, and the University of Illinois.

## FlexiFlow
-----------
**FlexiFlow** is a system that aims to improve performance and accuracy of end-to-end ML workflows during inference time.
